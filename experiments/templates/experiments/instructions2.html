            <p><b>Please read the following instructions carefully</b>. All the information contained here has also been
                given to you in printed format.</p>

            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the experiment you will be randomly divided into <b>groups of 6 members each</b>.
                During
                the
                whole experiment, you will interact only within your group. At the beginning of the experiment every
                participant
                receives an endowment of 40 EMUs (experimental money units) that will be later translated into real
                currency
                (euros) with a rate of 2 to 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the game, each member of the group will be able to invest the money received as an endowment in a
                <b>climate account</b> through several rounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                The climate accounts assigned to each group have a <b>minimum investment objective of 120 EMUs</b>. This
                means
                that if the accumulated contributions to the account after the experiment end, are equal or higher than
                120
                EMUs, then each member of the group will be able to keep the amount of the endowment that they didn’t
                invest.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, <b>if this minimum is not reached</b>, the computer will “throw a dice” so that <b>all group
                members
                will lose all their saving with a certain probability</b> p that will be communicated to you at the
                beginning of
                the experiment.
